## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".
  source order, inheritence, specificity, & important
- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
  It is the order that your CSS rules are written in your stylesheet.
- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
  By overriding with an inheritence
- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
  id, class, type
- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
  Because it will always have a greater specificity that will always be applied no matter what. This will cause bugs later along the line when future coders want to understand why a certain element isn't changing the way it should.
